    <h2>Spain</h2>
    <h3 style="color: blue">
      The Sexenio Revolution and the First Republic: 1868-74
    </h3>
    <p>
      Overthrow of the Monarchy and a period of relatively liberal policies in
      Spain. Pisses off conservative religious folks who see policies as a
      threat.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: red">The Bourbon Restoration: 1874-1931</h3>
    <p>
      A coup d'etat brings back monarchical rule. From 1923-1930, Spain ruled by
      a military dictator. I'd say pretty conservative. Conservative religious
      folk get their sense of power back.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: blue">The Second Republic: 1931-1939</h3>
    <p>
      A republican and socialist government is elected in what are generally
      considered fair elections. Pretty liberal. Pisses off conservative
      religious folks who see policies as a threat. It is true that many
      Catholic priests and other poobahs were assassinated by Republican
      sympathizers.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: red">Franco regime: 1936-1975</h3>
