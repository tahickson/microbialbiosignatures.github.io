    "content": "This project began as a Microsoft Access database to organize and track field locations, images, geochemical data, and other aspects of microbialite samples collected by Hickson and Bartley. As this resource grew, we realized that an open-source database for the scientific community could be used to answer important scientific questions about early life on Earth, life on other planets, evolution, and interpretations of paleoecology in the rock record. At the same time, it became clear that microbialite sedimentologists lacked a common, non-genetic, descriptive vocabulary for these important sedimentary features. That is until 2020, when Stan Awramik and Kath Grey published their Handbook for the Study of Microbialites. This free, online text provided an ideal starting point for the creation of a controlled vocabulary that geologists could use to describe a wide range of microbialites. We fully integrated their descriptive scheme into our database. It was at this point that we began to consider developing an open-source version for the geoscience community. ",

At this point we are keeping the front-end development in MS Access to allow the non-computer science team members to contribute. This will later be replaced by a web-based (React) front-end. Many of the pass-through queries created in this stage will transfer to Javascript-based code later. | In progress | . | Migrate back-end to Jetstream2 cloud server. Link MS Access front-end to this back-end and test. | In progress | . | Share MS Access front-end with small user group to get feedback on the database. What is working? What needs improvement? What features are missing? | May/June 2025 | . | Begin development of Javascript and React front-end with computer science team members and undergraduate computer science students. | Summer 2025 | . | Submit NASA and/or NSF proposals to support further development, integration with other paleobiology databases (API development), and improvements to schema and front-end. | Summer 2025 | . | Share initial database with scientific community at the Geological Society of American National Meeting to get feedback and encourage participation. | October 2025 | . | Integrate comments from community and develop working PostgreSQL backend with dynamic, web-based front-end. | Spring and Summer, 2026 | .

    "title": "The Hierarchy of Microbialite Traits",
    "content": "The Handbook for the Study of Microbialites (Awramik and Grey, 2020) (referred to as ‚ÄúThe Handbook‚Äù throughout this site) uses a hierarchical structure to describe microbialites in the rock record. This structure may not be familiar to many microbialite sedimentologists and we strongly encourage you to download The Handbook and use it as a reference. Our database avoids the use of Linnaean names, but it is possible to enter these into textboxes for cross-reference purposes. The basic, hierarchical structure emphasizes the multiscale nature of microbialite sedimentary structures and allows for a detailed, non-genetic description that encompasses all scales of observation. The image below illustrates this hierarchy. The first image shows an outcrop photo, unlabeled, of a limestone bed with microbial sedimentary structures. Most sedimentologists would recognize the domal bioherm in the lower half of the bed and the overlapping laminated limestones. The second image highlights the megastructures in this outcrop. There are two: the bioherm, an isolated buildup that formed some time before the overlapping, second megastructure, the laminated limestones that are found within a biostrome. In the third image, the megastructures are further subdivided into macrostrucutures, portions of the megastructure that have similar internal lithological and textural components. These macrostructures typically are of scales of decimeters. This example also illustrates another aspect of this hierarchy: some levels of the hierarchy might be coincident. The macrostructures in this case are equivalent to mesostructures, hand-sample scale portions of a macrostructure that have the same internal structures or textures. Mesostructures are, in our view, the outcrop-scale ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù of microbialtes and typically form the basis for field sample collection. Finally, in the fourth image we see microstructures, textures that can only be discerned at the microscopic scale, either in thin section or SEM analyses. These hierarchical levels form the basic structure for our database schema: . | Project or Citation Data: Descriptive metadata on the source of the data, such as age, general location, location name, citation(s), storage locale, etc. | Megastructure Data: Descriptive traits of megastructures, latitude, longitude (WGS84), and other aspects that describe the microbialite over large (&gt;1m) sizes as outlined in The Handbook. | Macrostructure Data: Descriptive traits of macrostructures as outlined in The Handbook | Mesostructure Data: Descriptive traits of mesostructures as outlined in The Handbook | Microstructure Data: Descriptive traits of microstructures as outlined in The Handbook | .

They require thorough, non-genetic descriptions that we can then interpret in terms of physical, chemical and biological processes.
