<h1>Scientific Questions</h1>

<p>
  By defining a common, non-genetic, controlled vocabulary for the description of microbial biosignatures and developing an open-source database based on that descriptive vocabulary, we should be able to answer a number of important questions. These include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>How have microbial biosignatures changed since their earliest occurrences in the Precambrian to the present?</li>
  <li>What is the interpretation and significance of these changes with respect to understanding the evolution of life on Earth, its atmosphere, and paleoecology?</li>
  <li>Is there really a sudden decrease in the diversity of microbial biosignatures as published, and oft-referenced, by Awramik, or is this just a reflection of the [low] quality of the database that he used to come to this conclusion?</li>
  <li>What is the full range of microbial biosignatures in the Earthâ€™s rock record? This is vitally important as the Earth is the actualistic model for seeking the rock evidence for life on other celestial bodies (such as Mars).</li>
  <li>Do certain paleoenvironments and geological time periods correlate with specific microbial biosignatures and why?</li>
</ol>
