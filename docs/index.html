<h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          We are a group of geoscientists working to create a database of
          microbialite biosignatures. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Morphological characteristics</li>
          <li>Textural traits</li>
          <li>Geochemical properties</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The traces of microbial metabolic processes in the rock record are, to
          us, equivalent to primary sedimentary structures and/or trace fossils.
          They require thorough, non-genetic descriptions that we can then be
          interpreted in terms of physical, chemical and biological processes.
          For this reason, our database makes extensive use of
          <a
            href="https://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Geological-Survey/Handbook-for-the-study-and-26950.aspx"
          >
            Handbook for the Study of Microbialites (Awramik and Grey, 2020) </a
          >, the first detailed non-genetic classification of microbialites to
          date.
