        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
          This project began as a Microsoft Access database to organize and
          track field locations, images, geochemical data, and other aspects of
          microbialite samples collected by
          <a href="team.html"> Hickson and Bartley</a>. As this resource grew we
          realized that an open-source database for the scientific community
          could be used to answer important
          <a href="science.html">scientific questions</a> about early life on
          Earth, life on other planets, evolution, and interpretations of
          paleoecology in the rock record.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, it became clear that microbialite sedimentologists
          lacked a common, non-genetic, descriptive vocabulary for these
          important sedimentary features. That is until 2020, when Stan Awramik
          and Kath Grey pulished their
          <a
            href="https://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Geological-Survey/Handbook-for-the-study-and-26950.aspx"
            >Handbook for the Study of Microbialites</a
          >. This free, online text provided an ideal starting point for the
          creation of a controlled vocabulary that geologists could use to
          describe a wide range of microbialites. We fully integrated their
          descriptive scheme into our database. It was at this point that we
          began to consider developing an open-source version for the geoscience
          community.

                non-computer science team members to contribute. This will later
                be replaced by a web-based (React) front-end. Many of the
